# MastersThesis_Calculations

This repository contains all scripts and calculations used to write my Master's Thesis on **Bistability and state switching in computational dynamic histone modification models**. The source files as well as the thesis itself can be found [here](https://github.com/mk36fyvy/MastersThesis).

For space reasons, the actual output files from the used [EpiDynaST](https://gitlab.com/mathemathilda/histsim) software could not be uploaded. However they can be reproduced by the seed number and the CLI parameters which can be found for each run in this repo.
